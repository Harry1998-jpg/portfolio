  <h2> About Harrison </h2>
  <article>
   <p> I am a software developer living in Baltimore Maryland. I've always had an interest in websites and how they're built since I was young. Free code camp was my entrance into
    the world of coding and I look forward to building upon that foundation with Thinkful. While my background is mostly in retail and food service, it has instilled a sense of teamwork that
    makes it very easy for me to work with others. Collaboration is one of the aspects of software developement that I most look forward to. In addition to being a software developer, I am also an aspiring writer, podcaster and
    have a passion for music. I hope to one day incorporate my many interests and hobbies into my career. </p>

  <h3> Ways I hope to incorporate my interests into my career may inlcude: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Making a webpage showcasing my favorite music artist </li>
      <li> Creating a webpage for my podcast </li>
      <li> Making a webpage for the television show I'm writing </li>
    </ul>
